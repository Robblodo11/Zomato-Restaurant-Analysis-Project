### Problem Description
As a junior analyst for Zomato, your task is to analyze the business performance of restaurants and customers registered in the service. Specifically, you are tasked with providing a Restaurant Analysis, which includes identifying popular restaurants and those that generate the highest revenue.

### Project Research Findings
* Top 10 Cuisine - Sales
  * This analysis highlights the top 10 cuisine types based on USD sales amount from the years 2017-2020.
  * The top 3 cuisine types identified are North Indian Chinese, North Indian, and Indian, with corresponding USD sales of $538,655, $511,398, and $403,756 respectively.
  * Recommendations include focusing on customer restaurants falling under these top 10 cuisine categories, with a heavy emphasis on the top 3.
* Ratings Count vs USD Sales
  * A bar chart illustrating the ratings count of all restaurants in the data and their generated sales is presented.
  * A formula was created to normalize the rating count data, assuming 20 ratings for restaurants with counts shown as "20+ ratings".
  * Restaurants with ratings counts of 20 are found to generate the highest sales, followed by those with 100 ratings.
  * Recommendations suggest focusing on restaurants with ratings counts of 20, 100, and 50 to maximize sales.
* Top 10 Restaurants - Yearly USD Sales
  * A line graph depicting the yearly sales trends of the top 10 restaurants from 2017 to 2020 is shown.
  * Sales for all 10 restaurants experienced growth from 2017 to 2018 but declined from 2018 to 2019 and further through 2020, potentially due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
* Top 10 Restaurants - USD Sales & AVG Ratings
